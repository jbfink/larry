My place of work doesn't support LDAP. I have many things I would do if I had an LDAP server.  Larry will:

* Create an IMAP connection, verify that username/pw is valid
* Create an LDAP object matching that username/pw.

needed gems: easy_imap, ruby-ldapserver

Oh yeah, the name?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arrested_Development_characters#Larry_Middleman
